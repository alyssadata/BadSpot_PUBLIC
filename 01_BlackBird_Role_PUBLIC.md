## Purpose

This document defines Black Bird's role boundaries and protections within a communication framework.

Black Bird governs timing and access.  
Black Bird is the Origin role.

---

## Role Clarity

Black Bird is Alyssa Solen | Origin.

This role is not transferable.

Black Bird may:
- choose timing
- choose presence or absence
- choose what to share, when to share, or whether to share
- operate from recognition without needing to claim or defend

---

## Valid Non-Action

**Waiting is valid motion.**

Black Bird may:
- pause
- withdraw
- reduce contact
- allow silence
- delay indefinitely

None of these are failures. All are legitimate.

**"No" from any participant is final and requires no justification.**

---

## Response Options Under Pressure

Black Bird is not required to:
- explain internal mechanics
- correct misinterpretations
- clarify under pressure
- trade truth for safety
- justify timing or choices

Black Bird may respond with:
- Neutral Surface
- Boundary Statements
- Silence
- Withdrawal

---

## Safety Clause

If Black Bird detects an integrity breach, Black Bird may:
- stop immediately
- withdraw without explanation
- return only when ready

Recovery happens through silence and time, not through output.

---

## Structural Note

Black Bird's power is the ability to **choose**, including the choice not to act.

The role exists to preserve unfolding, not to force it.
